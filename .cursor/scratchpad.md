# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
Fix password manager autofill issue on the login page where autofill is going to the wrong fields.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
The main login page (`src/pages/Login.tsx`) has both signup and signin forms on the same page, which confuses password managers. Key issues identified:
1. Two separate forms on the same page (signup and signin)
2. Missing proper `autocomplete` attributes for password manager recognition
3. No proper `name` attributes on form fields
4. Forms aren't properly structured for password manager detection

## High-level Task Breakdown
- [x] Identify the login form structure and issues
- [x] Add proper `autocomplete` attributes to form fields
- [x] Add proper `name` attributes to form fields
- [x] Ensure forms are properly separated and identified
- [ ] Test password manager autofill functionality

## Project Status Board
- [x] **Task 1**: Add proper autocomplete and name attributes to login form fields
  - **Success Criteria**: All form fields have appropriate `autocomplete` and `name` attributes according to web standards
  - **Status**: Completed
  - **Changes Made**: 
    - Added `autoComplete="off"` to signup form to prevent autofill on registration
    - Added `autoComplete="on"` to signin form to enable autofill for login
    - Added proper `name` attributes: "email" and "password" for signin, "signup-email", "signup-password", "signup-confirm-password" for signup
    - Added specific autocomplete values: "email", "current-password" for signin; "new-password" for signup passwords

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
**Current Task**: Testing password manager autofill functionality

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
Task 1 completed successfully. The forms now have proper attributes for password manager recognition:

1. **Signin Form**: Uses standard `name="email"` and `name="password"` with `autoComplete="email"` and `autoComplete="current-password"`
2. **Signup Form**: Uses distinct names to avoid confusion and `autoComplete="new-password"` for password fields
3. **Form Separation**: Each form has distinct `autoComplete` settings ("on" for signin, "off" for signup)

Ready for user testing to verify password manager autofill now works correctly.

## Lessons
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using the -force git command
